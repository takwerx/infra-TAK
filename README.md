# infra-TAK

Team Awareness Kit Infrastructure Management Platform.

One clone. One password. One URL. Manage everything from your browser.

**Current release: [v0.9.41-alpha](docs/RELEASE-v0.9.41-alpha.md)**

Older releases on the [GitHub Releases tab](https://github.com/takwerx/infra-TAK/releases) (or browse [`docs/RELEASE-*.md`](docs/) for inline release notes).

**Something broken?** Wrong sidebar version, **Update Now** error, merge/rebase/tag-clobber messages, or you are not sure the VPS ever pulled the real repo → go to **[Universal recovery (SSH)](#universal-recovery-ssh)** and run the one block there. **Point people at that section**; it is the single source of truth.

**Goal: universal installer.** Currently supported platform: **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**.

## Universal recovery (SSH)

Use this on the **VPS** when anything below is true:

- **Update Now** failed (including **`would clobber existing tag`**, merge/rebase errors, or a vague git error).
- The sidebar **VERSION** does not match the **Latest release** line at the top of this README (e.g. stuck on **v0.2.4** while the README says **v0.4.5-alpha**).
- You are unsure whether **`git remote -v`** points at **`github.com/takwerx/infra-TAK`** (forks, typos, and old mirrors leave **`origin/main`** years behind — **`git fetch origin`** is not safe until **`origin` is fixed**).

This pulls **`main` from the official repo URL** (same as **Quick Start**), checks **`VERSION`**, restarts the service. Your **`.config/`** is not touched.

```bash
cd $(grep -oP 'WorkingDirectory=\K.*' /etc/systemd/system/takwerx-console.service)
git fetch https://github.com/takwerx/infra-TAK.git main
git checkout --force -B main FETCH_HEAD
grep '^VERSION' app.py
sudo systemctl restart takwerx-console
```

**Check:** The **`grep`** line should show **`VERSION = "…"`** matching the current **Latest release** at the top (without the **`v`**, e.g. **`0.6.2-alpha`**). If it still shows an old number, you are in the wrong directory (compare with **`grep WorkingDirectory /etc/systemd/system/takwerx-console.service`**) or the fetch failed (network).

**Fix `origin` once (recommended):** so future **`git fetch origin`** hits upstream:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/takwerx/infra-TAK.git
```

**No `grep -oP`?** Run **`grep WorkingDirectory /etc/systemd/system/takwerx-console.service`**, **`cd`** to that path, then run the four lines starting with **`git fetch https://github.com/...`** (skip the **`cd`** line).

**Shallow / single-branch clone** (`fetch` errors): [docs/PULL-AND-RESTART.md](docs/PULL-AND-RESTART.md).

**After the console is up:** If **Guard Dog** is installed, open **Guard Dog** and click **↻ Update Guard Dog** once (see **Guard Dog** note under **Quick Start**).

**Why:** Older builds used **`git pull --rebase`** or bulk **`git fetch --tags`**, which break on many field installs. Current **Update Now** (v0.4.1+) is safer, but recovery over SSH must **not** trust a wrong **`origin`** — always use the **`https://github.com/takwerx/infra-TAK.git`** fetch above.

## What Is This?

A unified web console for deploying and managing TAK ecosystem infrastructure:

- **TAK Server** — Upload your .deb, configure, deploy, manage CoreConfig — all from the browser
- **Federation Hub** — Deploy and manage a TAK Server Federation Hub on this machine or a remote VPS, with Authentik SSO, certificate management, and Guard Dog monitoring
- **Authentik** — Identity provider with automated LDAP configuration for TAK Server auth
- **TAK Portal** — User and certificate management portal with auto-configured Authentik + TAK Server integration
- **Caddy SSL** — Let's Encrypt certificates and reverse proxy management
- **CloudTAK** — Browser-based TAK client
- **MediaMTX** — Video streaming server for real-time feeds
- **Node-RED** — Flow-based automation engine, protected behind Authentik forward auth
- **Email Relay** — Outbound email for notifications and alerts
- **Guard Dog** — TAK Server health monitoring and auto-recovery (port 8089, processes, OOM, PostgreSQL, CoT DB size, disk, disk I/O performance, certificates; optional monitors for Authentik, Node-RED, MediaMTX, CloudTAK, Federation Hub)

No more SSH. No more editing XML by hand. No more running scripts and hoping.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/takwerx/infra-TAK.git
cd infra-TAK
sudo ./start.sh
```

**First boot / automatic updates:** On a new Ubuntu VPS, **`apt`** may run right after SSH is available. **`systemctl status unattended-upgrades`** often shows **active (running)** for **`unattended-upgrade-shutdown`** — that idle process is **normal** and is **not** blocking installs. If **`apt-get`** still reports **“Could not get lock”**, wait until **`sudo fuser /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend`** shows nothing, then run **`sudo ./start.sh`** again. **`start.sh`** waits for **real** apt/dpkg activity and for **dpkg/apt lock files** before installing packages.

**Branches:** Default clone uses **main** (stable; tagged releases). For latest features and fixes before they're merged to main, use the **dev** branch: `git clone --depth 1 -b dev https://github.com/takwerx/infra-TAK.git`. The README and changelog here reflect main; dev may include remote deployment, UI tweaks, and fixes not yet in a release.

The script will:
1. Detect your OS (**Ubuntu 22.04 only** for now; goal is a universal installer)
2. Wait if automatic updates hold **apt/dpkg**, then install Python dependencies
3. Ask you to set an admin password
4. Start the web console

Then open your browser to the URL shown and log in.

**Updating:** After `git pull` or **Update Now**, restart the console with `sudo systemctl restart takwerx-console`. Your password and config live in the install directory's `.config/`. If you run `start.sh` from a different clone or path, the service keeps using the original install directory so your password continues to work. **Node-RED / Configurator code** (`nodered/`): after pulling **dev** on the VPS, also run **`bash nodered/deploy.sh`** from that install directory (see **[docs/PULL-AND-RESTART.md](docs/PULL-AND-RESTART.md)**).

**Guard Dog — automatic since v0.4.7-alpha:** Guard Dog scripts are automatically re-deployed when the console detects a version change. No manual button press needed after upgrading. The button still exists as a fallback if you change alert email or server nickname. Set **Notifications** → alert email and use **Send test email** to verify. Details: [docs/GUARDDOG.md](docs/GUARDDOG.md).

**Testing Update Now before you ship a release:** Maintainers should follow [docs/TESTING-UPDATES.md](docs/TESTING-UPDATES.md) on a test VPS (fake low `VERSION`, click **Update Now**, then restore). Pushing a Git **tag** is what shows customers “Update Available”; test the button before pushing the tag.

**Test & Evaluation procedure (T&E) before any merge to `main`:** Maintainers run the canonical soak/validation procedure in [docs/TEST-AND-EVALUATION-PROCEDURE.md](docs/TEST-AND-EVALUATION-PROCEDURE.md) on the dev fleet (currently `test6` / `test8` / `test12`, ≥60 min soak each) before proposing a release. **Two-actor protocol:** the operator does the `git pull` + `systemctl restart takwerx-console` manually on each test box (same path customers hit; catches pull-path failures under operator eyes); the agent does pre-flight, post-pull verification, the soak, the health-check matrix, and the PASS/FAIL gate. Operator says **“perform the test and evaluation procedure”** to trigger it.

**Upgrading from v0.1.x to v0.2.0:** v0.2.0 switches from Flask dev server to gunicorn (production server). The upgrade is automatic — just `git pull` and restart. On first restart, the console installs gunicorn, rewrites the systemd service, and starts the production server transparently. No manual steps needed.

**Password not working after update?** Use the **backdoor**: **https://&lt;VPS_IP&gt;:5001**. If login spins or fails, on the server run (from the directory where you do `git pull`, e.g. `/home/takwerx/infra-TAK`): **`sudo ./fix-console-after-pull.sh`** — it pins the config path in the systemd unit and prompts you to set a new password so you can log in again. Alternatively run `sudo ./reset-console-password.sh` from that same directory. After pulling, open the Caddy module and re-save your domain once so the Caddyfile (login bypass) is applied.

## Recovery / backdoor (when Authentik or Caddy is broken)

Git / version / **Update Now** issues: use **[Universal recovery (SSH)](#universal-recovery-ssh)** above, not this section.

If Authentik or Caddy is down and you can't reach **https://infratak.yourdomain.com**:

- **Backdoor:** Open **https://&lt;VPS_IP&gt;:5001** in your browser (use the server's real IP, not the domain). Log in with the **console password** you set when you ran `start.sh`. That path skips Caddy and Authentik, so you can get back into the console and fix things.

The console password is stored as a **hash** in the install directory at `.config/auth.json` (e.g. `/home/takwerx/infra-TAK/.config/auth.json`). You **cannot** recover the plaintext password from that file. If you forget it:

```bash
cd /home/takwerx/infra-TAK   # or your install path
sudo ./reset-console-password.sh
```

Enter a new password twice; the script updates `.config/auth.json` and restarts the console. Then use **https://&lt;VPS_IP&gt;:5001** with the new password. Store the console password somewhere safe (e.g. password manager); it's your only way in when the domain or Authentik is broken.

## Deployment Order

Deploy services in this order — each step auto-configures the next:

```
1. Caddy SSL         Set your FQDN, get Let's Encrypt certs (recommended first if using a domain)
         ↓
2. Authentik         Identity provider + LDAP outpost (automated deploy)
         ↓
3. Email Relay       Optional; configure SMTP for password recovery
         ↓
4. TAK Server        Upload .deb, deploy, configure ports + certs
         ↓
5. Connect LDAP      On TAK Server page — patches CoreConfig, creates webadmin in Authentik
         ↓
6. TAK Portal        User/cert management portal
         ↓
7. Anything else     CloudTAK, Node-RED, MediaMTX — any order
```

**Connect LDAP** runs after TAK Server deploy and wires LDAP auth to CoreConfig. 8446 webadmin login and QR enrollment work immediately after. **For MediaMTX-only (or standalone Authentik):** Deploy Authentik without TAK Server — it skips CoreConfig and webadmin; add TAK Server later and use Connect LDAP.

## Remote deployment and firewalls

Authentik, CloudTAK, MediaMTX, and Node-RED can be deployed to a **remote host** (separate from the infra-TAK console). You configure the target in each module's "Deployment target" (e.g. "On another server via SSH") and deploy from the console; the console SSHs to the remote and runs Docker/scripts there.

TAK Server supports a **two-server split**: Server One (PostgreSQL database) and Server Two (TAK Server core) on separate hosts. Configure both hosts in the TAK Server settings and deploy from the console.

**Firewall:** Depending on how you deploy, the infra-TAK host and remote host may need to reach each other for the automation to work. For example:

- **SSH:** The console must reach the remote on port 22 (or your SSH port) to run deploy and management commands.
- **Authentik remote:** After containers start, the console calls the remote Authentik API on port **9090** (e.g. `http://<remote>:9090`) to inject the LDAP outpost token. If the infra-TAK server and the remote are in different networks or behind firewalls, open port **9090** from the infra-TAK host to the remote so the token step can succeed; otherwise you'll see "Connection refused" in the deploy log and the LDAP container may stay unhealthy (403 token errors).
- **Two-server TAK:** Server Two (core) must reach Server One (database) on the **PostgreSQL port** (default 5432); open that port on Server One's firewall for Server Two's IP.

If a remote deploy fails at "token" or "API" steps, or a service reports unhealthy, check that the hosts can reach the required ports (SSH, 9090 for Authentik, 5432 for two-server DB, etc.).

## What Gets Automated

**Authentik Deploy (~7 minutes):**
Console ensures 4GB swap and starts PostgreSQL first, then server/worker after the DB is ready (reduces OOM and 502s on small VPS). Bootstrap credentials generated, LDAP blueprint installed, Docker Compose patched with standalone LDAP container, API polled for outpost token, CoreConfig.xml patched with LDAP auth block, TAK Server restarted.

**TAK Portal Deploy (~4 minutes):**
Repository cloned, container built, TAK Server certs (admin.p12, tak-ca.pem) copied into container, settings.json auto-configured with Authentik URL/token and TAK Server connection, forward auth configured in Caddy, 2-minute sync wait for Authentik outpost.

After deployment, create users in TAK Portal — they flow through Authentik → LDAP → TAK Server automatically.

## Requirements

- **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** (currently the only supported platform; goal is a universal installer). Fresh installation recommended.
- **Root access**
- **RAM:** 8 GB+ recommended for TAK Server; more if you run the full stack (Authentik, TAK Portal, Node-RED, MediaMTX, CloudTAK, Guard Dog).
- **Disk:** At max deployment (all modules) you can sit around **26 GB** used. Plan for growth: CoT data, logs, and retention. **50 GB+** disk is recommended so you have headroom; TAK Server's own minimum is 40 GB per the official configuration guide. Apply Docker log limits (Guard Dog → Apply Docker log limits) to avoid containers filling the disk.
- **Disk I/O:** SSD-backed storage strongly recommended. **Test your VPS before deploying** — slow disk I/O causes Docker build timeouts, service startup failures, and unreliable boots. See [VPS disk I/O check](#vps-disk-io-check) below.
- **CPU:** Enough cores for all processes (TAK Server, PostgreSQL, Authentik, Caddy, Node-RED, etc.). TAK Server's minimum is 4 cores; more is better for the full stack.
- **Internet** connection for initial setup.
- **TAK Server .deb** package from [tak.gov](https://tak.gov).

### VPS disk I/O check

Run this on your VPS **before deploying**. Poor disk I/O is the #1 cause of slow deploys and unreliable service startups.

```bash
# Write speed (sequential, sync)
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/testfile bs=1M count=1024 oflag=dsync 2>&1 | tail -1

# Read speed
dd if=/tmp/testfile of=/dev/null bs=1M 2>&1 | tail -1

# Clean up
rm -f /tmp/testfile
```

| Write speed | Assessment |
|-------------|------------|
| **400+ MB/s** | Good — SSD-backed, full stack will deploy and boot quickly |
| **200–400 MB/s** | Acceptable — deploys work, boot may be slightly slower |
| **< 200 MB/s** | Poor — expect slow Docker builds, service timeouts, longer boot sequences |
| **< 100 MB/s** | Bad — likely throttled or HDD-backed; migrate to a different node or provider |

Some VPS providers place instances on overloaded or HDD-backed storage nodes. If your write speed is consistently under 200 MB/s, contact your provider about migrating to a different node before troubleshooting service issues. The difference between a bad node and a good one can be 50 MB/s vs 500 MB/s on the same provider.

```

## Ports

> **v0.9.12 hardening:** Every host port is classified by exposure tier. **Tier 1 (Public)** is reachable from the internet, **Tier 3 (Caddy-loopback)** binds to `127.0.0.1` and is reached only via Caddy on 443, **Tier 4 (Docker-internal)** has no host port at all, **Tier 5 (Source-scoped)** is allowed only from a specific peer IP. Full policy: [docs/PORT-EXPOSURE-POLICY.md](docs/PORT-EXPOSURE-POLICY.md).

### Tier 1 — Public (open in UFW)

| Service | Port | Protocol | Description |
|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| infra-TAK Console | 5001 | HTTPS | Management web UI (backdoor: direct IP access) |
| Caddy | 80 | HTTP | Redirect to HTTPS |
| Caddy | 443 | HTTPS | Reverse proxy for all services (Let's Encrypt) |
| TAK Server | 8089 | TLS | TAK client connections (ATAK, iTAK, WinTAK) |
| TAK Server | 8443 | HTTPS | Admin WebGUI (client certificate auth) |
| TAK Server | 8446 | HTTPS | Admin WebGUI (Let's Encrypt, password/LDAP auth) |
| MediaMTX | 8554 | RTSP | Video streaming clients (publish + play) |
| MediaMTX | 8322 | RTSPS | TLS-wrapped RTSP |
| MediaMTX | 8890 | SRT | SRT streaming clients |

### Tier 3 — Caddy-loopback (bound to `127.0.0.1`, **deny in UFW**)

Reached only through Caddy on 443 via the public FQDN. Raw ports are NOT reachable from the internet. v0.9.12 enforces this via `!reset` Docker port overrides plus UFW deny rules.

| Service | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Authentik | 9090/9443 | Identity provider HTTP/HTTPS (Caddy proxies `https://authentik.example.com`) |
| TAK Portal | 3000 | User/cert management portal (Caddy proxies `https://portal.example.com`) |
| Node-RED | 1880 | Flow editor (Caddy proxies `https://nodered.example.com` with forward_auth) |
| MediaMTX | 8888 | HLS playback (Caddy proxies `/hls-proxy/` on the MediaMTX FQDN) |
| MediaMTX | 5080 | MediaMTX webedit (Caddy proxies the MediaMTX FQDN) |
| MediaMTX | 9898 | MediaMTX admin API (consumed by webedit on loopback) |
| CloudTAK | 5000 | CloudTAK API (Caddy proxies `https://cloudtak.example.com`) |
| CloudTAK | 5002 | CloudTAK tiles |
| CloudTAK | 18888 | CloudTAK media HLS |
| CloudTAK | 9997 | CloudTAK media admin API |
| CloudTAK | 9002 | MinIO web console (operator SSH-tunnels for bucket management) |

### Tier 4 — Docker-internal (no host port, **service reachable only on the Docker network**)

| Service | Internal endpoint | Description |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Authentik PostgreSQL | `postgresql:5432` | Authentik DB |
| Authentik Redis | `redis:6379` | Authentik task queue |
| CloudTAK PostGIS | `postgis:5432` | CloudTAK DB (was Tier 1 + default creds pre-v0.9.11 — root cause of the PG_MEM incident) |
| CloudTAK MinIO S3 | `store:9000` | CloudTAK S3 storage |
| CloudTAK events | `events:5003` | CloudTAK background worker |

### Tier 5 — Source-scoped (UFW allow from specific peer IP only)

| Service | Port | Source | Description |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|
| Server One PostgreSQL | 5432 (default) | Server Two IP | Two-server TAK Server DB (was unconditional `allow 5432/tcp` pre-v0.9.12) |
| Guard Dog health agent | 8080 | Console IP (`settings.server_ip`) | Two-server DB health endpoint on Server One |
| LDAP Outpost | 389/636 | Console IP | Reachable only when Authentik is deployed remotely; consumed by TAK Server's LDAP auth block |
| Email Relay | 25 | localhost | Local Postfix relay (apps send here) |

## Actions Reference (Sync, Update Config, Resync)

Each page has buttons that do specific things. Here's what they do and when to use them.

### TAK Server Page

| Button | What it does | When to use it |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Update Config** | Regenerates Caddyfile, reloads Caddy, installs Let's Encrypt cert on 8446, restarts TAK Server | After changing the TAK Server domain/FQDN in Caddy settings |
| **Connect TAK Server to LDAP** | Full LDAP setup: repairs Authentik blueprint, ensures service account + webadmin, writes LDAP auth block into CoreConfig.xml (without flat-file), restarts TAK Server | After deploying Authentik (if TAK Server was deployed first), or if LDAP auth stops working |
| **Resync LDAP to TAK Server** | Same as Connect LDAP — full re-run of the LDAP fix flow | If QR registration fails, if 8446 login stops working, after pulling console updates |
| **Sync webadmin to Authentik** | Pushes the 8446 webadmin password from settings into Authentik (no TAK Server restart) | After changing the webadmin password |
| **Disable/Enable flat-file auth** | Adds or removes `UserAuthenticationFile.xml` from the CoreConfig auth block, restarts TAK Server | When you want LDAP-only auth (disable) or need local password fallback (enable) |
| **Set JVM Heap** | Writes `-Xms`/`-Xmx` to `/opt/tak/setenv.sh`, restarts TAK Server | TAK Server running out of memory (OutOfMemoryError in logs) |

### TAK Portal Page

| Button | What it does | When to use it |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Sync TAK Server to TAK Portal** | Forces TAK Portal to re-read the TAK Server connection (IP, certs, API URL) | If TAK Portal dashboard doesn't show TAK Server uptime/disk usage |
| **Update Config** | Rewrites TAK Portal's `settings.json` with current Authentik + TAK Server URLs, restarts the container | After changing FQDN, after Authentik redeploy, if TAK Portal can't reach TAK Server or Authentik |
| **Sync TAK Server CA** | Copies the current `tak-ca.pem` into the TAK Portal container | After CA rotation — TAK Portal needs the new CA to generate valid client certs |

### Authentik Page

| Button | What it does | When to use it |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Update Config & Reconnect** | Patches docker-compose.yml (PostgreSQL tuning, blueprint mounts), ensures all forward auth apps exist (infra-TAK, TAK Portal, Node-RED, etc.), repairs embedded outpost, updates LDAP CoreConfig, reloads Caddy | After pulling console updates, if forward auth breaks, if apps disappear from Authentik, if LDAP stops working |
| **Fix LDAP Token** | Re-fetches the LDAP outpost token from Authentik API and injects it into docker-compose.yml, restarts the LDAP container | If LDAP container shows "unhealthy" or "403 Forbidden" in logs |

### Email Relay Page

| Button | What it does | When to use it |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Switch Provider** | Reconfigures Postfix with new SMTP credentials/host, restarts Postfix | Changing email provider or From address |
| **Configure Authentik** | Pushes relay settings (localhost:25, From address) into Authentik so password recovery emails work | After deploying or switching Email Relay provider |

### General Rules

- **Deploy order matters:** Caddy → Authentik → Email Relay → TAK Server → TAK Portal → everything else
- **After pulling console updates:** Hit "Update Config" on Authentik, then optionally on TAK Server if you changed FQDN
- **If TAK Portal can't reach TAK Server:** Hit "Sync TAK Server to TAK Portal" on the TAK Portal page
- **If LDAP auth breaks:** Hit "Connect TAK Server to LDAP" on the TAK Server page
- **If forward auth breaks (502/blank on FQDN URLs):** Hit "Update Config" on the Authentik page
- **After CA rotation:** Hit "Sync TAK Server CA" on the TAK Portal page, then have users re-enroll

## Access Modes

**IP Address Mode** — Self-signed certificate, works anywhere (field deployments, no DNS needed)

**FQDN Mode** — Caddy + Let's Encrypt for proper SSL. Required for TAK client QR enrollment. Can upgrade from IP mode through the web console without SSH.

## QR Code Enrollment

| Client | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| ATAK (Android) | ✅ Working | Requires FQDN mode with Let's Encrypt |
| TAKAware (iOS) | ✅ Working | Works in both IP and FQDN mode |

## Security

- Password required before any access (set during `./start.sh`)
- HTTPS from the start (self-signed or Let's Encrypt)
- Session-based authentication
- All config files are 600 permissions
- Authentik bootstrap credentials auto-generated per deployment

## Design notes

- **[References](docs/REFERENCES.md)** — Canonical links (e.g. [TAK Server API](https://docs.tak.gov/api/takserver)) for development and integration.
- **[Authentik login branding](docs/AUTHENTIK-LOGIN-BRANDING.md)** — Custom CSS vs **Brand → Attributes** (`theme: dark`), black backgrounds, flow wording; links to official Authentik docs and community guides.
- **[Guard Dog](docs/GUARDDOG.md)** — How Guard Dog works: monitors, 15‑minute boot delay and cooldowns, TAK Server soft start (after PostgreSQL and network), 4GB swap on deploy for memory stability, and restart-loop protection. Apply Docker container log limits from the Guard Dog page without redeploying a module.
- **[MediaMTX access driven by TAK Portal / LDAP](docs/MEDIAMTX-TAKPORTAL-ACCESS.md)** — How stream.fqdn admin vs viewer logic can be driven from TAK Portal (one place to manage users, no separate MediaMTX or Authentik user management). **Do not configure the email/SMTP portion of MediaMTX** — request access and approval notifications are handled by TAK Portal's open request-access page and Email Relay.

---

## Changelog

### v0.9.40-alpha — 2026-05-27 — Azure PostgreSQL end-to-end support + CloudTAK first-time setup guide + MediaMTX readiness fix

**Headline: four areas.** (1) **Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server** — full end-to-end External DB support: auto-create `cot` database, grant `azure_pg_admin` to `martiuser`, pre-create all 5 required extensions as admin so SchemaManager never hits the extension permission wall, Test Connection Azure extension probe with exact portal instructions if any are missing, collapsible Azure pre-flight guide in the UI, uninstall drops the remote `cot` database for clean re-deploy. (2) **External DB UX fixes** — button order corrected (Provision → Test), admin username field uses placeholder instead of hardcoded `postgres`, passwords with `#` no longer break psql `-v` parser, provision correctly targets `postgres` DB first, deploy mode preserved after Configure. (3) **CloudTAK first-time setup guide** — collapsible three-step card on the CloudTAK page: create `cloudtakadmin` in TAK Portal (with org-suffix warning), download `user.p12` + cert password from Certificates page, configure CloudTAK with `takserver.fqdn` + credentials + cert; bootstrap is one-time, subsequent users just log in with username and password. (4) **MediaMTX readiness poll** — deploy now waits up to 30s for `systemctl is-active mediamtx` before declaring success, eliminating the "Not Found" error when operators hit `stream.fqdn` immediately after deploy.
